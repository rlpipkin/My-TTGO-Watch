# FAQ

## how to make a screenshot?

![screenshot](images/screen8.png)

In the display settings page 2 you can set what happens when the button is pressed for 2 seconds.
This will normally takes you back to the main tile.
If the option for a screenshot is activated, a screenshot is taken instead.
This can be downloaded via the built-in FTP server (binary and passive mode, username: TTWatch and password: passord), if activated.
The file name is screen.data.

Or the other way:

The firmware has an integrated webserver. Over this a screenshot can be triggered. The image has the format RGB565 and can be read with gimp. From bash it look like this
```bash
wget x.x.x.x/shot ; wget x.x.x.x/screen.565
```

## how to change background?

You can change background in the display settings.

If you want to use your own background image, simply upload a PNG with a resolution of 240x240 pixels via ftp to the Watch and name it bg.png and set it in the display settings page 2.
